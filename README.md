#Flappy Bird 2.0

Devastated that the original Flappy Bird was no longer available on the App Store, I wanted to make my own version of the game. Flappy Bird 2.0 is an arcade-style single-person game where the player is in control of a bird icon that is moving persistently to the right (as shown by a parallax background).

The bird will automatically descend and pressing the spacebar will allow the bird to jump and ascend. The player’s objective is to navigate the bird through an endless series of paired pipes with equally sized gaps. These pipes are placed at random heights and colliding with the pipe or the ground will end the gameplay while each successful pass through a pair of pipes will award the player with one point.

The player’s high score will be saved and the game over screen will prompt the player to play again.

A practice mode is also avalable for a easier level of difficulty, but the score earned in the practice mode will not be recorded as a high score.
